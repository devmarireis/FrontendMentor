## Overview
 QRcode Challenge

 A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.

## My process
First self-made project using HTML and CSS. I have been studying for a while and felt I was not being able to retain knowledge. However, once you set out to do a project you realize that things just flow. I was happy with the result, although I have a few things to improve.
 
### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned
Things are simpler than they appear. Take some time to really look at the image and work out a plan. If something goes wrong, google it. Don't go chasing after perfection if you are a beginner. Just make it happen, like I did!

### Continued development

I need to fix more knowledge about margin and padding, I think.
Work more on divs.

Learn about Flexbox and Grid.
